# On our first call to findBestSubarray, we use for loops to visit
# every element of nums. Then, we split the array in half and call
# findBestSubarray with each half. Both those calls will then iterate
# through every element in that half, which combined is every element
# of nums again. Then, both those halves will be split in half, and 4
# more calls to findBestSubarray will happen, each with a quarter of
# nums. As you can see, every time the array is split, we still need
# to handle every element of the original input nums. We have to do
# this logN times since that's how many times an array can be split
# in half.
#
# The extra space we use relative to input size is solely occupied by
# the recursion stack. Each time the array gets split in half, another
# call of findBestSubarray will be added to the recursion stack, until
# calls start to get resolved by the base case - remember, the base
# case happens at an empty array, which occurs after logN calls.
